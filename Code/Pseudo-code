1. Import necessary libraries (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
2. Load the HRV dataset using Pandas
3. Inspect the dataset for understanding its structure and contents
4. Select the variable of interest (e.g., LF/HF ratio, Mean rate)
5. Perform statistical analysis or data visualization
   a. For visualization, use Matplotlib/Seaborn to create plots like histograms, scatter plots
   b. For statistical analysis, compute relevant statistics like mean, median, standard deviation
6. Interpret the results to gain insights into HRV patterns
7. Document findings and observations
