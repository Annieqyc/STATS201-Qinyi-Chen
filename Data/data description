This data is downloaded from an open database which is the “Derivation and Validation of Heart Rate Variability Based Scoring Models for Continuous Risk Stratification in Patients with Suspected Sepsis in the Emergency Department by Machine Learning Algorithms”(Chen, 2020). This database includes a wide range of HRV-related features, nonlinear dynamics measures, and other statistical parameters that could be useful for analyzing heart rate variability. The data contains “Mean.rate”, the original source of mean heart rate; “Coefficient.of.variation”, the data of Heart Rate Variability; “LF.HF.ratio.LombScargle”, LF (Low Frequency) to HF (High Frequency) ratio calculated using Lomb-Scargle power spectral analysis, often related to autonomic nervous system activity.
This dataset can help us understand the raw data of HRV and its detailed characteristics. With the comprehensive data, the machine learning model can possibly be built.
