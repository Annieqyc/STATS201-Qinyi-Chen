This sampled data was downloaded from an online database:
https://www.kaggle.com/code/guanlintao/eda-pca-ml-nurse-stress-prediction/notebook#Model-Performance
According to the researcher, this is a dataset for "Continuous Stress Monitoring of Hospital Nurses". The original research applied XGBClassifier and LGBMClassfier to predict the stress level in hospital nurses. 

Read the dataset:
X,Y,Z: Orientation data 
EDA: Electrodermal Activity
HR: Heart Rate
TEMP: Skin Temperature
label: Categorical states (of stress level)

Since the dataset "merged_data.csv" was too big to be uploaded to the repository, I selected 1000 rows of the data into the "sampled_data.csv" file. However, the data analysis process should be done using "merged_data.csv", which is accessible in the link.
