Machine learning models for the identification of cognitive tasks using autonomic reactions from heart rate variability and electrodermal activity.
This study focuses on using heart rate variability (HRV) and electrodermal activity (EDA) indices, alongside machine learning models, to identify tasks based on autonomic responses elicited by them. The research was carried out in response to the need for non-invasive measures to identify tasks performed by individuals, aiding in monitoring and guidance to avoid reduced performance due to stressors like fatigue. The research raised the question of whether indices of HRV and EDA can be used to accurately classify different cognitive tasks like psychomotor vigilance, auditory working memory, and continuous visual search. Besides, the research also focuses on finding the algorithm that does most effectively differentiates the autonomic responses to various tasks and most accurately in classifying the tasks using non-invasive measures (Posada-Quintero & Bolkhovsky, 2019). 
The machine learning methodology that best fits this paper is prediction. Because the paper aims to use physiological indices to identify the specific task. This objective aligns with predictive modeling, which involves using historical data to predict unknown outcomes or classifications. Additionally, the four machine learning algorithms, which are K-nearest neighbor (KNN), support vector machines (SVM), decision trees, and discriminant analysis (DA), are commonly used for predictive purposes.
By comparing the effectiveness of different algorithms, a conclusion was drawn by hypothesizing that “HRV and EDA can distinguish between tasks, with the most accurate models being KNN (66%), linear SVM (62%) and linear DA (62%)” (Posada-Quintero & Bolkhovsky,2019, p.1). The research is important in professional environments where task performance demands varied skills and poses different physiological challenges. The findings could influence individual monitoring in various high-stress professions and improve performance management. Therefore, it has great potential for application in various fields requiring monitoring of task performance and stress management.
